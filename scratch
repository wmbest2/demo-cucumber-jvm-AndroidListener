Feature: Sum
  As a user
  I want to be able to add digits
  So that I can compute a sum

  Background:
    Given I launch the app

  Scenario: Sum 1 and 1
    When I add 1 and 1
    And I press enter
    Then I should get 2.0 as the result

  Scenario Outline: Sum
    When I add <first> and <second>
    And I press enter
    Then I should get <result> as the result

    Examples:
      | first | second | result |
      | 4     | 2      | 6.0    |
      | 1     | 1      | 2.0    |
